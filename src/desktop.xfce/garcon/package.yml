summary    : Xfce freedesktop.org compliant menu library	
description: |
    Garcon is a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based on GLib and GIO.
    It was started as a complete rewrite of the former Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to garcon, was lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus modified with menu editors.
